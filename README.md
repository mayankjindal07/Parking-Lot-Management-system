Parking Lot Management System

The Parking Lot Management System is a simple yet efficient system implemented in C++ to manage vehicle parking in a parking lot. This system allows users to park vehicles, remove vehicles, and view the current status of parking spaces.

Features

Vehicle Parking: Allows users to park vehicles in available parking spaces.
Vehicle Removal: Enables users to remove vehicles from the parking lot when they leave.
Status Display: Displays the current status of parking spaces, including occupied and available spaces.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive command-line interface for easy interaction with the system.
